About Us

Harold's Buttery Biscuits is the best place in town to dine on big, flaky, buttery biscuits. Founded in 2011, we've been the go-to spot for gourmet meal and dessert biscuits.

Our Founder: Harold Butterfield

Growing up, Harold's favorite comfort food was his mother's homemade biscuits. At the end of the school week, she would always have a fresh batch waiting for him upon his return home. Harold sought to recreate that feeling of comfort for others to enjoy, and created a menu of tasty options that will satisfy any appetite!
